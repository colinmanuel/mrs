# Static HTML Site for Dog Boarding

This is a simple, one-page site for a local dog boarder. The goal was to give the site a home-spun feel to ensure that it didn't resemble the more sterile experience seen on most commercial dog kennels.

## Technology

The site relies on the following:
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Start Bootstrap - Grayscale](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-grayscale)
* [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
* CSS3 patterns by [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/css3patterns/)

## TO DO
* Add Lazy Loading for images
* Add Grunt file compression
* Add Google Analytics
* Add meta data
* Add favicon
