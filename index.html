                    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>We are a family of dog lovers. We believe that dogs need lots of sunshine, human contact, play time and freedom to do what they do naturally. Our mission is to provide a place where dogs can board in a low stress environment where they can get plenty of exercise, socialization and exploration.<p>
                    <p>To ensure the best possible care, we only accept a small number of guests at a time in 
                    addition to our permanent residents. We offer our guests spacious, shaded yards, the ability to play with compatible companions and lots of access to nature. Dogs spend the best parts of the day playing outdoors and sleep in enclosed climate controlled kennel rooms at night.</p>
                    <p>A day at our homestead consists of morning rotations, breakfast, and yard play. Indoor rest time occurs midday followed by afternoon play. Later, supper is served, evening rotations follow and then bedtime.</p>
                    <p>We hope your dog(s) enjoy their stay with us.</p>

                    <h2>Reservations</h2>
                    <p>Our facility is different than some in that we are family owned and operated, we live on-site and are open for year-round boarding. We do close a couple of times per year for revitalization.  Please contact us for more information regarding these dates.</p>
                    <p>Reservations should be made with as much advance notice as possible, as we serve during the busiest times of the year and offer a limited capacity.

                    <h3>How It Works</h3>
                    <p>When making a reservation, please review our <a  class="page-scroll" href="#terms">terms and forms</a>. After that please contact us to set up an <em>initial visit if you have not been directly referred by one of our existing clients</em> so that we can meet your dog/s and ensure that we are the right match for the care needed. Concerns with new guest dogs range from issues of aggression, puppies that are extremely young and haven’t received their complete round of vaccinations, dogs with specialized needs that we might not be able to care for or other concerns such as extreme barkers, or dogs that can and will jump 4 ft. enclosures.</p>
                   
                    <p>Mother Rock Star Dogs is situated on 1.3 acres in Garfield, Texas, 4 miles east of ABIA and 4 miles north of Hwy 71 East between Austin and Bastrop.</p>

                    <h3 id="terms">Terms & Forms</h3>
                    <p>All visitors must provide proof that they are current on all their required vaccinations (Rabies, Distemper/Parvo and Bordetella). We recommend Bordetella be administered every 6 months. Please provide shot records at your initial visit. Owners must complete and sign the boarding information form and read and sign release forms.</p>
                    <p>All visiting dogs must be flea and tick free or treated with Frontline or Advantix 48-hours prior to their visit to the country!</p>
                    <p><b><a href="assets/MRS%20Transportation%20Release%20All.doc">MRS Forms</a></b></p>

                    <p>Note: Actual signatures are needed of the dog/s official owner. You may return the forms either by mail or email scanned copies.</p>

                    <h3>You’ve decided to go with MRS Dogs</h3>
                    <p>After your reservation is confirmed, we will send you detailed directions to our homestead facility if you haven’t already been here for your initial visit. We ask that you schedule appointments for your drop-off and pick-up times between the hours of 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. Please note that our appointment times are like any other appointments you may have at a doctor's office, etc. Please allow 30 - 45 minutes travel time prior to your scheduled appointment. If you are running late or early , please communicate this with us in a timely manner by calling 512/350-5624 or call our secondary emergency number 512/669-3101. We utilize all of our yards and waiting extended periods for client arrivals causes our guest dogs to lose outdoor time. We also like to create a calm environment for guest dog’s arrivals and departures.  Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.</p>

                    <h3>Does Mother Rock Star Dogs accept unaltered dogs?</h3>
                    <p>Not unless they are puppies under the age of 8 months. It has been our experience that unaltered dogs significantly effect the energy levels within the groups in a way that sometimes is not conducive to successful play. </p>

                <div class="faq-block" id="faq-mission">
                    <h3>What is the mission of Mother Rock Star Dogs and what should we expect?</h3>
                    <p>We provide year-round boarding in a low-stress, natural environment giving our guest dogs the best care possible. We offer socialization of all sizes and ages. The only rule is &ldquo;to play well with others.&rdquo; Our capacity at this time is approximately 60 depending on size during the height of the busy seasons. Our goal is to allow our guest dogs as much outdoor time as possible with lots of human contact, access to nature and the ability to play with compatible companions. Our visitors typically play in groups that vary in numbers ranging in size and depending on personality. Indoors, our goal is to provide comfortable individual spaces of their own where they can eat and rest peacefully. We use large crates and cages. Bedding is provided, but clients are welcome to send their own. We feed <i>Nurture Heavenly Holistic Harvest Dog Food</i>, which we believe is a wonderful and (have found to be an agreeable) kibble, plus the dogs really seem to like it, but again clients are welcome to send their own food of preference. We intend to send each dog home as clean as possible, but like with kids, some play harder than others and can tend to get a bit grubby. </p>

                    <h3>What makes Mother Rock Star Dogs different from other boarding facilities?</h3>
                    <p>You will know the people who are caring for your dog rather than a staff that comes and goes. We will be able to give you honest feedback about their stay and are able to build relationships with each and every one of them. We are a great choice for active young dogs, dogs of all sizes/ages and are also a really great match for much older dogs. Most always when our elderly visitors get out here they are revitalized with all the new surroundings, they really love it!</p>

Annie and Snoopy always do a great job of managing the dogs on hand, and of introducing Kodi and getting him integrated into the pack.  Kodi is always happy to arrive, and exhausted when he leaves --- we could tell that he had played hard and been well looked after!  Equally important, MRSD always makes it easy on people, too; they accommodate our travel schedule, are very convenient to the airport, and completely eliminated our usual dog boarding worries when we travel.  Kodi can't wait to get back!"<br>-Bryan Sauer</p>

                    <p>Our dogs are our children so we are extremely grateful to have MRS Dogs as our first and only choice for boarding.  Annie and Snoopy Melvin and MRS Dogs have all the bases covered.  Their veterinary experience and connections with vet clinics assure us that any medical concerns that our dogs should have will be expertly addressed.  The grounds of MRS Dogs are spacious and shaded by huge trees, so our Pointer and Terrier have plenty of room to &ldquo;hunt&rdquo; and run, while our lazier Lab and Chihuahua have lots of shade and cool earth for napping.  Last but not least, MRS Dogs is a place where animals are loved and the dogs receive true affection as part of their care.  We would not want to take our dogs anywhere else and now that MRS Dogs have expanded their business to year round boarding, we don't have to.  We strongly recommend MRS Dogs and we look forward to them being our dogs' home away from home for many more years to come.<br>

                    <p>My favorite feeling, when heading off to work or a big weekend without the dog is driving up to the Mother Rock Star Dogs driveway and watching Geoff get all excited. I don't like to travel without my dog and feel guilty when I have to. My worries melt away knowing that Annie and Snoopy and their family will not only take superb care of my sweetest baboo, but also that they will make sure that Geoff  has the time of his life. When we pull up to the house he always jumps out of the car and trots straight into the yard, not even turning back for a hug from me. When I pick him up, he is smiley, happy, dirty and tired. My dog likes to play hard and I can tell when he has. He usually conks out in the car and sleeps all the way home. I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else for boarding and I am so thankful for the Melvin's hospitality.

                    <p>I wouldn't have my dogs go anywhere else. My 11-month old puppy is bursting with energy and was able to run around and play with other dogs in a safe and loving environment rather than be stuck in a crate all day long. Annie is naturally gifted with animals and caters to each dog's needs/personality. She goes to great lengths to ensure the safety and well being of each &ldquo;guest&rdquo; and has extensive knowledge of canine behavior. It means a lot to not have to worry about my beloved pets while I am away.  I know they are getting the best care and a vacation of their own. When I picked up Cisco, I was greeted by a happy, healthy, exhausted animal. Mother Rock Star Dogs is truly a special place.<br>-Laura K. </p>
